	12 30 am - 1 00 am ----  Discussion on Projects

2. Chat window will be off while explanation. If you have a doubt, you can ask on chats or you can also ask me to unmute you. 

3. Concepts + Practical Demonstration 
	
	Linear Regression 
	Jupyter notebook with the working example of Linear Regression
	Exercise - In class exercise (do it and submit - 10-15 min)
		   Take away exercise (do it at home and submit - 1 hr 					exercise)
	
4. Before starting any topic I will tell you the agenda of the session in advance. For you it is necessary to go through the agenda in self learning videos. 

5. For every session I will share you the notes, datasets, exercises and agenda

6. Any practice problems to be solved only on practice labs. 
	If you are using any other platform then I wont be able to assist you
	with any issues. 

7. Final Assessment Projects - 

	Project 1 requires understanding of A, B and C concepts. 

8. Github profile - Tutorial 
   Blogs -  
   Solve Hackathons -
